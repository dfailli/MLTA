## Extending finite mixtures of latent trait analyzers for bipartite networks for the analysis of COVID-19 data

These codes allow the application of latent variable models in the context of network data, using a fast variational inference approach. The MLTA model developed by Gollini and Murphy (2014) and Gollini (2020) is able to cluster sending nodes in bipartite networks, as well as to capture the latent variability of network connections within each cluster. The MLTA model is extended to account for the influence of nodal attributes in cluster formation. The goal is to identify clusters of COVID-19 patients adopting similar behaviors against pandemic, also understanding how socio-economic and demographic features, as well as perception of the pandemic, influence cluster formation.
